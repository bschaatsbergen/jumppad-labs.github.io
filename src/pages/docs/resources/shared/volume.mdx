## volume

A volume type allows the specification of an attached volume.

<Properties>
  <Property name="source" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The source volume to mount in the container, can be specified as a relative `./` or absolute path `/usr/local/bin`. Relative paths are relative to
the file declaring the container.
  </Property>
  <Property name="destination" type="string" required="true" value="">
    The destination in the container to mount the volume to, must be an absolute path.
  </Property>
  <Property name="type" type="string" required="false" value="bind">
    The type of the mount, can be one of the following values:

    - bind: bind the source path to the destination path in the container
    - volume: source is a Docker volume
    - tmpfs: create a temporary filesystem
  </Property>
  <Property name="bind_propagation" type="string" required="false" value="rprivate">
    Configures bind propagation for Docker volume mounts, only applies to bind mounts, can be one of the following values:

    - shared
    - slave
    - private
    - rslave
    - rprivate

    For more information please see the Docker documentation [https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation)
  </Property>
  <Property name="bind_propagation_non_recursive" type="boolean" required="false" value="false">
    Configures recursiveness of the bind mount. By default Docker mounts with the equivalent of `mount --rbind` meaning that mounts below the the source directory are visible in the container. 
    For instance running `docker run --rm --mount type=bind,src=/,target=/host,readonly busybox` will make `/run` of the host available as `/host/run` in the container -- and to make matters
    even worse it will be writable (since only the toplevel bind is set readonly, not the children). If `bind_propagation_non_recursive` is set to `true` then the container will only see an
    empty `/host/run`, meaning the `tmpfs` which is typically mounted to `/run` on the host is not propagated into the container.
  </Property>
  <Property name="selinux_relabel" type="string" required="false" value="">
    Configures Selinux relabeling for the container (usually specified as :z or :Z) and can be one of the following values:

    - shared (Equivalent to :z)
    - private (Equivalent to :Z)
  </Property>
</Properties>
